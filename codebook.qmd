1. `Island` 
    - The Island that the fox was captured in.
        - SRI - Santro Rosa Island
        - SMI - San Miguel Island
2. `GridCode`
    - SRI - 18 grids (sites) trapped between July-Sept each year; each grid consists of 12 traps checked once each 24 hour period for 6 consecutive days
    - SMI - 4 grids (sites) trapped Sept each year; each grid consists of 18 traps checked once each 24 hour period for 5 consecutive days
3. `TrapResult`
    - Result of the Trap
        - OPEN - trap is open and undisturbed
        - FOX - fox in trap
        - SKUNK - skunk in trap
        - CLOSED - trap closed but otherwise undisturbed
        - RO - "raided open", trap open, but bait is missing (bait can be removed by mice, insects, and birds, so does not necessarily indicate that target species visited the trap)
        - RC - "raided closed", trap closed, and bait missing
        - ES - "escaped skunk", skunk slipped out through door crack before biologist arrived; we can tell a skunk was present in trap from trenching and nesting material inside trap
        - EF - "escaped fox", there was a fox in the trap but it escaped from the handler before a pittag could be recorded
4. `Pittag`
    - Unique identifier given to each individual captured (same as a microchip that cats and dogs get, inserted under the skin)
5. `CaptureType`
    - N - first time ever captured, receives pittag
    - P - previously pittaged, but first capture of the trapping season (July-January)
    - R2 - recapture, has already been captured during this trapping session (grid)
    - R1 - has already been captured this trapping season (July-January), but this is the first time this season it has been captured at this site (grid)
6. `Vaccinations`
    - N or NA - received no vaccine
    - R - received rabies vaccines
    - D - received canine distemper vaccine
    - C - received canine distemper vaccine
    - RD - received rabies and canine distemper vaccine
    - RC - received rabies and canine distemper vaccine
    - SEN - this animal is a disease sentinel and will not receive vaccines during its lifetime
7.  `ReproductiveStatus`
    - N - not active(ly reproductive) has not had kits this season (for females, for males we cannot tell)
    - L - lactating
    - SL - signs of lactation (but no longer actively lactating) has had kits this season
    - SV - there is one of these in the dataset and I think it is a mistake and should be SL
    - TD - testes distended (male ready to breed, we do not record this often as we specifically do not trap during breeding season which is Feb-March)
8. `AgeClass`
    - 0 - kit, born that year
    - 1, 2, 3, 4 - successive values given to record amount of tooth wear on molar, from 0 (none) to 4 (the most)
